# C++ Slot Map

## Overview

A Slot Map is a data structure that provides an efficient way to manage a collection of items while allowing for stable references to those items, even after removals and insertions. It is a useful data structure for scenarios where you need fast item lookup and you want to avoid the shifting of elements that can occur with other data structures like arrays or vectors.
